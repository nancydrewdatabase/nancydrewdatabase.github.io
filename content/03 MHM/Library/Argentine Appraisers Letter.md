Dear Sir,

I represent a client who would like to sell their collection of post Civil War gold bullion. My client wishes to remain anonymous during all business transactions and I am having difficulty determining the nature of their collection. From what I can gather, my client possesses approximately $50,000.00 in uncirculated bank standard gold coins dated between 1870 and 1880. These would have been issued by one of the 5 major banks that were located in California at the time.

Please contact me at your convenience. I am available during mornings and evenings.

Respectfully yours,

*Louis Chandler*

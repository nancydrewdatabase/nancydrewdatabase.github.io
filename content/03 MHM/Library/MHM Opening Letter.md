*Dear Bess,*

*Hello, from Stormy San Francisco! This time I'm staying in a beautiful Victorian mansion. You'd love the room I'm in. It's full of old Chinese furnishings and some interesting knick-knacks.*

*The owner of the house, Rose Green, is a friend of Hannah and asked me to come out and help her with some renovation work. She and her friend, Abby, hope to turn the place into a bed and breakfast by next month. But, from what I've gathered, Rose isn't sure if she can open in time. Ever since they've started the renovations, they've had lots of accidents. Could it be just bad luck, or is there something more sinister at work? I'm sure I'll find out.*

*Love, Nancy*

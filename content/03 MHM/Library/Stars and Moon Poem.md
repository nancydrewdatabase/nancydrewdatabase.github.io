*Diego,*
*I've waited so long for your return but have kept our treasure true. Here is the tool you'll need to find it. May your rainbows never run out of luck*.
*E.*

### Junior Variant

The stars and moon will shine on you 
As you begin your quest.
Travel to the corners first
Visit all from East to West
Then Journey back into the center
Where you will surely see
The sun shone over all the land
In perfect harmony

### Senior Variant

The stars and moon will shine on you
As you begin your quest.
Move like a [[Lessons in Chess | knight upon his horse ]]
To quickly pass the test
Take care to keep your path in check
Along the outside border,
So you may see the sun return
To claim its rightful order.

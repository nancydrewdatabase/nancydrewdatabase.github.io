### Music Theory

#### Note Reading

The staff is made up of five lines and four spaces.

Musical notes are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet (A B C D E F G).

A clef is a musical symbol placed as the beginning of the staff that determines the letter names of the lines and spaces.

There are two main types of clefs.

Treble clef.
𝄞

Bass clef.
𝄢

The clef you will see on your music will depend on what type of instrument you’re playing.

𝄞 E F G A B C D E F

𝄢 G A B C D E F G A

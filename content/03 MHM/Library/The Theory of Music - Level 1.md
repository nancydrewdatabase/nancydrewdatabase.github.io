### Music Theory

#### Note Reading

The staff is made up of five lines and four spaces.
```music-abc
|
```
Musical notes are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet (A B C D E F G).

A clef is a musical symbol placed as the beginning of the staff that determines the letter names of the lines and spaces.

There are two main types of clefs.

Treble clef.
```music-abc
|
```

Bass clef.
```music-abc
V: V2 clef=bass
[V: V2]|
```
The clef you will see on your music will depend on what type of instrument youâ€™re playing.

E F G A B C D E F

```music-abc
E8 F8 G8 A8 B8 c8 d8 e8 f8|
```
G A B C D E F G A
```music-abc
V: V2 clef=bass
[V: V2]G,,8 A,,8 B,,8 C,8 D,8 E,8 F,8 G,8 A,8|
```

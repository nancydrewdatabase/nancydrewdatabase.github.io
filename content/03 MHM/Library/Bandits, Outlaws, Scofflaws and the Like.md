### [[Diego Valdez |El Diablo]]

Not much is known about this masked bandit, who plagued the Domingo Baca Trail between 1875 and 1880, except for his trademark black outfit and mask. Many legends associate him with "The Great Christmas Robbery," but contemporary historians now believe the robbery was fabricated by the stagecoach company, since the treasure was never found.

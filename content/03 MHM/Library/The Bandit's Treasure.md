This is the tale of the bandit's loot
And how it came to be.
That golden dream of blissful love
Soon failed you and me.
Oh, my love,
Ride far and fast for me.
I'll wait in Yerba Buena town,
In a house high above the sea.

I traveled as far as the Golden Gate
Where I held your treasure true
Where the rainbow ends in Christmas gold
And phoenix rises, too.
Oh, my love,
Ride far and fast for me.
I'll wait in Yerba Buena town,
In a house high above the sea

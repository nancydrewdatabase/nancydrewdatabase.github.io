The Chinese horoscope is organized on a 12 year cycle with each year assigned to a certain animal. While the origin of these animal signs is unclear, many believe that they were named by Buddha. But before he departed from Earth, he summoned all the animals, but only 12 came to bid him farewell. As a reward he named a year after each one in the order they arrived. First came the Rat, then the Ox, the Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar. Thus we have 12 signs today.

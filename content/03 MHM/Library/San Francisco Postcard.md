Dear Mom and Dad,

Sorry I haven't written in a while, but things have been busy. I'm working now - fixing up an old house. I'm learning a lot and am very proud of the work I'm doing. 

I'm still in between places, so I'll let you know what my address is once I settle down.

Say Hi to Grandma.

Charlie

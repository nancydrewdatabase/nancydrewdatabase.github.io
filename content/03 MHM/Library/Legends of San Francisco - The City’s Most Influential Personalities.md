Chapter 5: LOCAL CELEBRITIES

APPLEGATE, Lizzie

Well-loved by San Franciscans, both for her cultural and humanitarian contributions, Lizzie Applegate was a talented actress and songwriter who began her career entertaining miners at local gold camps.

In 1880, Lizzie wrote and starred in the tremendously successful play, The Bandit’s Treasure, whose cast included Norma Dentfin, Lenore Scoast and Pam Doree.

This initial success was followed by a string of other hits, including *The Riddle of the Chinese Box*, *The Fire in the Phoenix Eye*, and *Rainbow’s Gold*.

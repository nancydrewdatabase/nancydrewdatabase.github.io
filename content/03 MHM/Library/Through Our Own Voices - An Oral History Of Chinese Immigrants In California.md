My name is Wing Tang. When I was just 19, I worked as a grader on the transcontinental railroad and saw the two great railroads meet at the Golden Spike. I came back to San Francisco in 1871 and worked as a chef for Miss [[Elizabeth Applegate | Applegate]] for many years at the Hotel Chinois and then at the Golden Gardenia, which we called [[Translate “Gum Bo Fu” | Gum Bo Fu]].

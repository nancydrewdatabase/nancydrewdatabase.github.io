## Solution
### Poem

Listen my [[子 Child]], to the story of dreams

And know that the [[元 Beginning]] is more difficult than it seems

When the ten [[女 Daughters]] are reunited in order

When the [[四 Four]]-sided box loses its border

When the [[目 Eye]] of the Phoenix is in your hand

When the bird of [[火 Fire]] can see you again

When the [[月 Moon]] sleeps and the sun plays

The [[王 King]] of the sky will shine his rays

And hidden beneath the [[川 River]] of colors

Will lie a gate to [[金 Gold]]en wonders
